Our project is about how we implement the BFS, A*, Dijkstras algorithms and graphs to create a fun game about a ghost trying to hunt the player. We use a user interface along with sound effects where players can
click the nodes to traverse through the tree. The objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible. Do you have the guts to play this game.
